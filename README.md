GuessTheFlag is a simple matching game. In the app the user is presented with the name of a country and 3 images of possible flag options. Users must click the correct flag to earn a point. An alert lets the user know if they are right or wrong and if they are wrong they are informed which country that flag belongs to. The game lasts 8 rounds and presents the user with their final score (1 point per correct answer) at the end in the form of an alert.
